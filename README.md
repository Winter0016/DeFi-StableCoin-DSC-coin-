🏦 DeFi Stablecoin Protocol — Project Overview

This project consists of two main smart contracts:

1️⃣ DecentralizedStableCoin Contract (DSC Token Contract)

Acts as the stablecoin token contract.

Minting and burning can only be performed through the DSCEngine contract.

Represents a decentralized, over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to $1 USD.

Stores user-owned DSC token balances.

2️⃣ DSCEngine Contract (Core Logic Contract)

Handles all core protocol functionality:

Deposit collateral (WETH or WBTC)

Mint DSC tokens

Redeem collateral

Liquidate under-collateralized positions

Only accepts WETH and WBTC from pre-existing contracts deployed on the Sepolia testnet:

WETH: 0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81
WBTC: 0x8f3Cf7ad23Cd3CaDbD9735AFf958023239c6A063


Integrates Chainlink Price Feeds for secure, reliable USD pricing of collateral assets.

Includes a Chainlink data freshness safeguard:

If price feeds have not been updated for more than 3 hours, liquidation operations become temporarily blocked.

This is currently implemented only for liquidation, but will be extended to minting, depositing, and redeeming collateral.

3️⃣ Testing Suite

The protocol has been thoroughly tested on both:

✅ Local Development Network (Anvil)

✅ Sepolia Testnet

Testing methodologies include:

🧪 Unit Tests — ensure individual logic correctness
🎲 Stateless Fuzz Tests — verify behavior under random inputs
🔁 Invariant (Stateful Fuzz) Tests — enforce protocol-level safety rules such as:

The system must never become under-collateralized

Total DSC supply must always remain fully backed by collateral

These tests ensure protocol resilience, security, and stability under a wide variety of conditions.
